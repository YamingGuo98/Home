  title={Out-of-Distribution Generalization of Federated Learning via Implicit Invariant Relationships},
  abstract={Out-of-distribution generalization is challenging for non-participating clients of federated learning under distribution shifts. A proven strategy is to explore those invariant relationships between input and target variables, working equally well for non-participating clients. However, learning invariant relationships is often in an explicit manner from data, representation, and distribution, which violates the federated principles of privacy-preserving and limited communication. In this paper, we propose \textsc{FedIIR}, which implicitly learns invariant relationships from parameter for out-of-distribution generalization, adhering to the above principles. Specifically, we utilize the prediction disagreement to quantify invariant relationships and implicitly reduce it through inter-client gradient alignment. Theoretically, we demonstrate the range of non-participating clients to which \textsc{FedIIR} is expected to generalize and present the convergence results for \textsc{FedIIR} in the massively distributed with limited communication. Extensive experiments show that \textsc{FedIIR} significantly outperforms relevant baselines in terms of out-of-distribution generalization of federated learning.},
